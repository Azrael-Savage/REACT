          As a software engineer with a passion for technology, math, and science,
          I am committed to staying on the cutting edge of innovation. With my
          experience and education in software engineering, I am confident that I
          can make valuable contributions to any team. In addition to my technical
          skills, I bring a unique perspective to my work, thanks to my love for
          travel, reading, baking, cooking, and cars. By staying curious,
          creative, and driven, I am dedicated to achieving exceptional results
          and building innovative solutions. With my self-motivation, ambition,
          and natural curiosity, I am a software engineer who is committed to
          excellence. I just finished a web development boot-camp at the
          University of Utah and am halfway through my 4-year program in CS:
          Software Engineering at Utah Valley University. As a mother of two, I
          understand the importance of dedication and hard work, and I am
          committed to bringing my best to every project. I am excited to
          collaborate with a team that shares my passion for technology and
          innovation.
