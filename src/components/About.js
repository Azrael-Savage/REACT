			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				As a software engineer with a passion for technology, math, and science,
				I am committed to staying on the cutting edge of innovation. With my
				experience and education in software engineering, I am confident that I
				can make valuable contributions to any team. In addition to my technical
				skills, I bring a unique perspective to my work, thanks to my love for
				travel, reading, baking, cooking, and cars. By staying curious,
				creative, and driven, I am dedicated to achieving exceptional results
				and building innovative solutions. With my self-motivation, ambition,
				and natural curiosity, I am a software engineer who is committed to
				excellence. I just finished a web development boot-camp at the
				University of Utah and am halfway through my 4-year program in CS:
				Software Engineering at Utah Valley University. As a mother of two, I
				understand the importance of dedication and hard work, and I am
				committed to bringing my best to every project. I am excited to
				collaborate with a team that shares my passion for technology and
				innovation.
